# What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, networks, programs, and data from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. Its main goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

In todayâ€™s digital age, almost everything relies on internet-connected systems. Without proper cybersecurity, individuals and organizations are vulnerable to attacks from hackers, malware, and other threats that can cause financial loss, data breaches, and damage to reputation.
